%% Part1 Question a

% The boundary counditions are two side fixed to V0(1V in this case) and 0, two
% other sides free.Due to a constant conductance(sigma), the result is a
% flat surface with 1V on left on 0V on bottom.

%% Part1 Question b
% The boundary conditions are two sides fixed to V0 (1V) and two sides
% fixed to ground. The current flow from 1V to 0V, with 90degree change of
% direction. The curve is smooth because of a constant conductance.

% The
% analytical solution is also solved. The accuracy of the numerical method
% depends on the mesh size. On the other hand, the accuracy of analytical
% solution depends on the number of the series included. The more series
% included, the more accurate result can be expected, but due to the
% infinite number of series available, the result is still an
% (close enough) approximation.

%% Part2 Question a
% Sigma plot shows a lower conductivity in box region, as expected.
% Therefore more current will flow across the higher conductivity region.
