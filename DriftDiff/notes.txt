n and p doped in the middle
P>n, p majority, resulting a positive voltage
diff/drift? mainly diffusion but p pulling n?
recombination
n,p,np-ni down, what's max n max p?

new file: const Nd
disturbance result constant n and p?
disturbance is the initial normal distribution

coupled in if condition -> rho is zero!
two carriers-> single carrier why accumulate on sides
RC -> two carriers condition-> recombination
whyyyyy does RC off np still goes uniform????
